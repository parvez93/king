working with the git

go to your AWS management console

login with your root user account

select services and then EC2

Launch  a LINUX MACHINE  (AMAZON LINUX AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM)

//note:- you don't select AMAZON LINUX 2 AMI(HVM)


ssh into it with putty and run the following commands

$sudo su

$yum -y update		//(update the repository)

$yum install git		//(to install the git )

$yum install tree -y		// to install tree command

$git --version		//to verfiy the git installed and check its version

//the first thing we do after the git installation is

//to setup the global user name and user email address i need to run these commands


$git config --global user.name "jeetubhai"		// you may customise it to yours name

$git config --global user.email "engrjsingh4472@gmail.com"  //you may customise it to yours email

$git conif --global colour.ui true

//so in a particulare project we may have more than 1 developer contributing codes to the central repository i.e. git

// so here i m going to create a project into my local repository as a developler 1 and after that  i would like to push it to the central repository


$mkdir dev1			// create a folder (dev1) as local repository for developer1

$cd dev1				//get into that folder

now every project file has to pass through these three stages 

1. untracked
2. stage
3. commited


command			
$ls -la			// verify the existing files or directories... it will show empty directory


$git init 			// to initialise the git in the directory dev1

$ls -la			// verify that it list .git directory

$tree .git			//it will display the sub directories of the .git

//now let the developer1 starts the coding... i.e. creating files...i.e. file1.txt

$touch 1.txt		// create a file named 1.txt

$git status		// to see the state of 1.txt

$git add 1.txt			// to add the file to the stage

$git status		// to see the state of 1.txt again


$git commit -m "1.txt added by dev1"	// to add the file to the commited...

//now let the developer1 starts the coding... i.e. creating files...i.e. file2.txt

$touch 2.txt		// create a file named 2.txt

$git status		// to see the state of 2.txt

$git add 2.txt			// to add the file to the stage

$git status		// to see the state of 2.txt again


$git commit -m "2.txt added by dev1"	// to add the file to the commited...



//now let the developer1 starts the coding... i.e. creating files...i.e. file3.txt

$touch 3.txt		// create a file named 3.txt

$git status		// to see the state of 3.txt

$git add 3.txt			// to add the file to the stage

$git status		// to see the state of 3.txt again


$git commit -m "3.txt added by dev1"	// to add the file to the commited...
